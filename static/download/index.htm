  <h3>I want to use the Ohm framework</h3>
  
  <p>You don't actually have to download anything &mdash; well, almost. The entire process for installing the Ohm Framework tools on your computer and creating your first application are documented in <a href="<{url:tutorials/install.htm}>">this tutorial</a>.</p>

  <h3>I want to contribute&nbsp!</h3>

  <p>Thank you&nbsp;! There are two git repositories, one for the <a href="https://github.com/VictorNicollet/Ohm">core framework</a> and one for the <a href="https://github.com/VictorNicollet/Ohm-Plugins">official plugins</a>. You can fork them and submit pull requests.</p>
  
  <p>You can also fix spelling mistakes on this website from <a href="https://github.com/VictorNicollet/Ohm-Site">this repository.</a></p>
