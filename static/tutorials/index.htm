<p class="abstract">
  All the introductory articles and tutorials for starting out with the Ohm Framework. Everyone was a newbie once. 
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Ohm uses the OCaml language. You don't have to be an expert, and the tutorials will cover most of the complex parts anyway, but a minimal working knowledge of OCaml is recommended. If you can, take a little time to follow the <a href="http://try.ocamlpro.org/">Try OCaml</a> interactive tutorial.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/">OCaml Manual</a> is a great reference, but not a good learning aid.</p>

<p>
  <b>Extra credit</b>: while you won't be forced to use them, Ohm works well with <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">Coffeescript</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS CSS</a>, <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> and the <a href="http://ocaml-batteries-team.github.com/batteries-included/hdoc2/">Batteries</a> library for OCaml. As you become more experienced, you might want to read up on these as well.
