<h3>Why static pages</h3>

<p>Static pages are the easiest way to get HTML displayed on a visitor's screen, but this comes at the cost of making it harder to use dynamic content on these pages, including variables coming from the database or internationalization.</p>

<p>The typical use cases for static pages are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A landing page built using custom HTML.</li>
  <li>This tutorial.</li>
  <li>A blog entry on a developer's personal web site.</li>
  <li>The <i>Terms and Conditions</i> page.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the heart of a static page is a large block of HTML, you are allowed to make the surrounding HTML dynamic. This includes rendering links to the previous or next article, or manipulating a comments feed below an article.</p>

<h3>Enabling static pages</h3>

<p>To publish static pages, you need to install the corresponding plugin. Run this command in the root directory of your project:</p>

<pre>ohm plug ohmStatic</pre>

<p>The plugin should now be enabled. Next, create a <code>/static</code> directory in the root directory of your project, and add an <code>index.htm</code> file there: </p>

<pre><div class="src">/static/index.htm</div>&lt;p>Hello, world&nbsp;!&lt;/p></pre>

<p>Many ohm plugins have a <abbr title="Do What I Mean">DWIM</abbr> running mode which is executed for all enabled plugins when the project build process begins. The DWIM mode of the <em>ohmStatic</em> plugin recursively explores the <code>/static</code> directory in the project root, and turns any files found inside into either pages (for the <em>.htm</em>, <em>.html</em> and <em>.md</em> extensions) or downloadable files (any other extensions). </p>

<h3>Displaying static pages</h3>

<p>The <em>ohmStatic</em> plugin build step turns your static pages into assets, but does not display them. You now need to write a short bit of OCaml code to do so:</p>

<pre><div class="src">ocaml/cStatic.ml</div><{ocaml:OhmStatic.export 
  ~server:  O.server 
  ~title:   "My Example Page"
  Static.site}></pre>

<pre><div class="src">ocaml/cStatic.mli</div><{ocaml:(* Empty file *)}></pre>

<pre><div class="src">ocaml/main.ml</div><span class="light">module Controllers = struct
  open CErrorPage</span>
<{ocaml:  open CStatic}>
<span class="light">end</span></pre>

<p>These additions will do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In a brand new controller file <code>cStatic.ml</code>, export the site (available as <code>Static.site</code>) on the default server <code>O.server</code> using &laquo;&nbsp;My Example Page&nbsp;&raquo; as the default title for each page.</li>
  <li>Provide an empty interface file <code>cStatic.mli</code> to improve compiling time: you may change the implementation file as often as you want, files that depend on that implementation file will not have ot be re-built as long as the interface file remains unchanged. </li>
  <li>Add <code>open CStatic</code> to the list of controllers in <code>main.ml</code> so that the application will include the code that was just written.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once this is done, run <code>make</code> in the project root, and visit <a href="http://ice-cream.local">http://ice-cream.local</a> in your web browser to see the new static page appear (you may need to refresh your page before it appears).</p>
