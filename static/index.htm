<p class="-important">Ohm is an open source web framework<br/>for the OCaml language</p>

<ul class="-features">
  <li>
    <h4>Write bug-free code</h4>
    <p>
      OCaml prevents a wide range of runtime errors: misnamed variables or functions, out-of-bounds accesses, null reference exceptions, even forgetting to perform a necessary step in a computation. You will never need to write an unit test, unless you are writing extremely complex algorithms or using regular expressions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Keep your code short</h4>
    <p>
      Code written in OCaml is about as long as code written in Ruby or Python. The Ohm framework provides several abstractions to keep typical web application code as short as possible, and the language's design lets you adapt or extend these abstractions easily.  
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Don't worry about performance</h4>
    <p>
      OCaml comes ahead of most interpreted languages in terms of execution speed, and the Ohm framework architecture handles the rest: database accesses are reordered for higher performance, long tasks are offloaded to worker processes, and you can easily add more servers to handle traffic spikes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Don't reinvent the wheel</h4>
    <p>
      While the Ohm framework provides a lot of essential functionality out of the box, its real power lies in its plugin system. You can find plugins for almost anything &mdash; uploading to Amazon S3, paging item lists, storing audit trails, hashing passwords, CSV exports...
    </p>
